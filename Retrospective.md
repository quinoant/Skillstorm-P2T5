# What Went Well
## We finished our pipeline with time to spare
<ul>
    <li>We planned well, not too structured in regards to the data being there</li>
    <li>This allowed for us to improvise as we learned more about the dataset</li>
    <li>It also lead us to just dive into the data with a semi-structured plan</li>
</ul>

## Worked Well As A Team
<ul>
    <li>Good Communication</li>
    <li>Constant Updates</li>
    <li>Dividied up work well</li>
    <li>Common understanding of goals and work to be done</li>
</ul>

## Individial Initiative
<ul>
    <li>Didn't go to eachother over every problem</li>
    <li>Looked for solutions individually</li>
    <li>Used time effectively didn't even need to work outside of work hours</li>
</ul>

## Goal Orientation
<ul>
    <li>Had a definitive end goal and well defined use cases</li>
    <li>Everything we did was towards that goal</li>
</ul>



# What Didn't Go Well / Hindrances 

## Tracking What Was Done
<ul>
    <li>Wasn't clear what had been done at times</li>
    <li>Lead to some tables not being written to silver layer</li>
</ul>

## Getting Caught up with a problem
<ul>
    <li>Too much focus on a specific way to get timestamp</li>
    <li>Lost a lot of time due to this</li>
</ul>

## Creating the ERD
<ul>
    <li>Lucid chart has a limit on shapes</li>
    <li>Lead to multiple charts for same layer leading to confusion</li>
</ul>

# What We Could Improve On

## Being Systematic
<ul>
    <li>Scattershot work lead to confusion about current status</li>
    <li>Should focus on a clear plan of execution every day</li>
</ul>

## Time Estimates
<ul>
    <li>Underestimating by a lot for each task</li>
    <li>Lead to poor planning</li>
</ul>

## Star Schema
<ul>
    <li>Ended up using a snowflake instead of a star</li>
    <li>Due to misunderstanding of denormalization</li>
</ul>

# How Would You Do It Again

<ul>
    <li>Get all of the tables we dropped for time(forkee,review, and release)</li>
    <li>Finding a better erd site</li>
    <li>Optimization, finding better ways to do things</li>
</ul>
